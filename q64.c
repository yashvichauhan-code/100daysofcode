//Find the digit that occurs the most times in an integer number.
//Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target value 
//within a sorted array [1]. It works by repeatedly dividing in half 
//the portion of the array that could contain the target, 
//eliminating large parts of the data in each step
